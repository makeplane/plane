1,Midjourney,Commercial,"midjourney, MJ, Discord, v6, stylize, chaos, artistic","[prompt] --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6.1","--ar (aspect), --style (raw/default), --stylize (0-1000), --chaos (0-100), --weird (0-3000), --seed, --no","Artistic interpretation, consistent style, excellent composition, great for concepts","No API, Discord-only, limited control, no inpainting in v6","1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:2, 21:9, 2:3","Multi-prompt weighting cat::2; use /describe for reverse prompting; --style raw for photorealism"
2,DALL-E 3,Commercial,"dalle, dall-e, openai, gpt-4, natural language, API","Natural language description without parameters. Be descriptive, conversational.","HD quality (in prompt), vivid style (in prompt), natural size (in prompt)","Excellent text rendering, natural language understanding, API access, safety guardrails","Limited style control, no parameters, no negative prompts, can refuse prompts","1024x1024, 1792x1024, 1024x1792","Write like describing to a human; specify text content, font, placement explicitly; avoid keyword lists"
3,Stable Diffusion,Open Source,"SD, SDXL, ComfyUI, A1111, local, open source, LoRA","(important:1.3), normal, (less:0.8) + Negative: ugly, blurry, deformed","CFG Scale (7-12), Sampler (DPM++), Steps (20-50), LoRA, Embeddings, Weights (word:1.2)","Full control, local/private, LoRAs, inpainting, ControlNet, customizable","Learning curve, requires hardware, quality varies by model","Custom any ratio","Use (word:1.2) for emphasis; negative prompts essential; CFG 7-12; DPM++ 2M Karras sampler"
4,Flux,Open Source,"flux, schnell, dev, pro, BFL, open source, fast","Natural language, weighted prompts, --guidance scale","--guidance (strength), aspect ratio in prompt","Fast generation, good quality, natural prompts, open weights","Newer platform, fewer resources, limited community models","Various via prompt","Use natural descriptions; specify style directly; guidance scale 3.5 for balanced results"
5,Nano Banana Pro,Google,"nano banana, gemini, google, imagen, multimodal, text rendering","Narrative paragraphs. 32K context. ALL CAPS emphasis. Hex colors #9F2B68.","aspect_ratio (1:1 to 21:9), image_size (1K/2K/4K), responseModalities","Best text rendering, multimodal input (14 images), search grounding, thinking mode","Newer platform, learning curve, style consistency","1:1, 2:3, 3:2, 3:4, 4:3, 4:5, 5:4, 9:16, 16:9, 21:9","Narrative > keywords; ALL CAPS for critical; hex colors for precision; NEVER for negatives; photography terms anchor quality"
6,Imagen 4,Google,"imagen, google, photorealistic, high quality, commercial","Natural language, descriptive, aspect ratio in text","Quality level, aspect ratio specified in prompt text","Photorealistic quality, good text rendering, commercial use","Limited style range, newer platform","Various via prompt","Be descriptive; specify aspect in prompt text; use photography terminology"
