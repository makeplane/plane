STT,Technique,Category,Keywords,Description,When to Use,Syntax Example,Platforms,Tips
1,Emphasis Capitalization,Formatting,"caps, emphasis, important, critical, priority, MUST","Use ALL CAPS for critical requirements that must not be ignored","When specific elements are non-negotiable","MUST include blue sky.

3,Negative Prompts,Refinement,"negative, avoid, exclude, remove, no, without, ban","Specify what to exclude from the generated image","To prevent common artifacts or unwanted elements","Negative: ugly, blurry, deformed, watermark, extra limbs","SD, Flux, Leonardo","Essential for SD/Flux; organize by category (anatomy, quality, style); keep concise"
4,Multi-Image Reference,Identity,"reference, identity lock, face match, style transfer, consistency","Use multiple images to maintain subject identity or style","For consistent character generation or style matching","Upload 6 object + 5 human refs (Nano Banana up to 14 images)","Nano Banana, Midjourney, SD","Collage multiple refs into single image for efficiency; specify which image for what purpose"
5,JSON Structured Prompts,Organization,"JSON, structured, organized, layered, metadata, schema","Use JSON format for complex, multi-layer prompt organization","For detailed scene descriptions with many parameters","{ ""subject"": {}, ""environment"": {}, ""camera"": {}, ""lighting"": {} }","Nano Banana, any","Helps organize complex prompts; include meta_data, subject_layer, environment_layer, composition_and_tech"
6,Narrative Description,Natural,"narrative, paragraph, story, descriptive, natural language","Write prompts as flowing paragraphs like briefing a photographer","For models that understand natural language well (32K+ context)","A professional portrait of a woman in her 30s, standing in an urban setting at golden hour...","Nano Banana, DALL-E","More effective than keyword lists for Gemini; include context, mood, and intention"
7,Photography Anchoring,Quality,"photography, camera, lens, DSLR, professional, shot","Use photography terms to anchor quality and realism","For photorealistic results and specific camera aesthetics","Captured with Canon EOS 90D, 85mm lens, f/1.8, shallow DOF, natural lighting","All platforms","Include camera model, lens, aperture, lighting setup; triggers photorealistic training data"
8,Color Precision,Accuracy,"hex, color code, precise color, #, RGB, specific color","Use hex color codes instead of vague color names","When exact colors are critical","Background: #9F2B68 (dark magenta) instead of 'dark magenta'","Nano Banana, any","Hex codes are unambiguous; include color name for context; use for brand colors"
9,Aspect Ratio Control,Composition,"aspect ratio, ar, dimensions, ratio, format, orientation","Specify exact aspect ratio for output dimensions","When specific dimensions are required","--ar 16:9 (Midjourney) OR aspect_ratio='16:9' (Nano Banana)","All platforms","Match platform requirements; 1:1 social, 9:16 stories, 16:9 widescreen, 21:9 cinematic"
10,Iterative Refinement,Workflow,"iteration, refine, version, variation, A/B test, improve","Generate variations and refine based on results","For achieving optimal results through multiple generations","Generate 4 variations → Select best → Refine weights → Upscale","All platforms","Start broad, narrow down; save seeds for reproducibility; document successful prompts"
11,Scene Layering,Composition,"foreground, midground, background, layers, depth, z-index","Describe scene in distinct depth layers","For complex scenes with depth","Foreground: cherry blossoms. Midground: person walking. Background: Mount Fuji at sunset.","All platforms","Creates visual depth; helps AI understand spatial relationships"
12,Style Mixing,Creative,"blend, mix, fusion, combine, hybrid, mashup","Combine multiple artistic styles","For unique hybrid aesthetics","Art nouveau meets cyberpunk, or '80s synthwave crossed with ukiyo-e woodblock print","Midjourney, SD, Nano Banana","Use 'meets', 'crossed with', 'fusion of'; weight styles if needed"
13,Negative Constraints,Safety,"NEVER, avoid, exclude, prohibit, ban, NO","Explicit statements of what must not appear","To prevent unwanted content or artifacts","NEVER include text or watermarks. DO NOT add any UI elements. Avoid red tones.","Nano Banana, DALL-E","More effective than negative prompts for some models; be specific and explicit"
14,Camera Movement (Video),Motion,"pan, tilt, dolly, tracking, crane, zoom, motion","Specify camera movements for video generation","For AI video generation","Slow dolly forward, then gentle pan right revealing the landscape. Fade to next scene.","Veo, video platforms","Use cinematography terms; specify speed and direction; include transitions"
15,Identity Lock,Consistency,"identity, face lock, same person, consistent, preserve","Techniques to maintain subject identity across generations","For consistent character representation","Use reference as EXACT facial reference. STRICT identity lock. NO face modification.","Nano Banana, SD (LoRA)","Upload clear reference; explicitly state preservation requirements; use JSON locks"
16,Multi-Panel Composition,Layout,"panel, grid, collage, multi-image, split, diptych","Request images with multiple panels or sections","For comics, comparisons, before/after","2x2 grid showing: [top-left description], [top-right description], [bottom-left], [bottom-right]","Nano Banana, Midjourney","Describe each panel clearly; maintain consistency across panels; specify layout (2x2, 1x3, etc.)"
17,Search Grounding,Real-time,"search, real-time, current, live data, grounding, factual","Enable real-time data for accurate current information","For current events, accurate data visualization","tools=[{'google_search': {}}] - enables real-time weather, charts, events","Nano Banana only","Use for infographics with current data; weather-accurate scenes; current event imagery"
