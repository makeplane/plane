## Step 4: Test Framework Bootstrap

**Detect existing test framework and project runtime:**

```bash
setopt +o nomatch 2>/dev/null || true  # zsh compat
# Detect project runtime
[ -f Gemfile ] && echo "RUNTIME:ruby"
[ -f package.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:node"
[ -f requirements.txt ] || [ -f pyproject.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:python"
[ -f go.mod ] && echo "RUNTIME:go"
[ -f Cargo.toml ] && echo "RUNTIME:rust"
[ -f composer.json ] && echo "RUNTIME:php"
[ -f mix.exs ] && echo "RUNTIME:elixir"
# Detect sub-frameworks
[ -f Gemfile ] && grep -q "rails" Gemfile 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:rails"
[ -f package.json ] && grep -q '"next"' package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "FRAMEWORK:nextjs"
# Check for existing test infrastructure
ls jest.config.* vitest.config.* playwright.config.* .rspec pytest.ini pyproject.toml phpunit.xml 2>/dev/null
ls -d test/ tests/ spec/ __tests__/ cypress/ e2e/ 2>/dev/null
# Check opt-out marker
[ -f "<harness-config-dir>/no-test-bootstrap" ] && echo "BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED"
```

**If test framework detected** (config files or test directories found):
Print "Test framework detected: {name} ({N} existing tests). Skipping bootstrap."
Read 2-3 existing test files to learn conventions (naming, imports, assertion style, setup patterns).
Store conventions as prose context for use in Phase 8e.5 or Step 7. **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If BOOTSTRAP_DECLINED** appears: Print "Test bootstrap previously declined — skipping." **Skip the rest of bootstrap.**

**If NO runtime detected** (no config files found): Use ask_user_question with the options below. If the ask tool is unavailable, ask the same question in plain text and wait for the answer.
"I couldn't detect your project's language. What runtime are you using?"
Options: A) Node.js/TypeScript B) Ruby/Rails C) Python D) Go E) Rust F) PHP G) Elixir H) This project doesn't need tests.
If user picks H → write `<harness-config-dir>/no-test-bootstrap` and continue without tests.

**If runtime detected but no test framework — bootstrap:**

### B2. Research best practices

Use web_search to find current best practices for the detected runtime:
- `"[runtime] best test framework 2025 2026"`
- `"[framework A] vs [framework B] comparison"`

If web_search is unavailable, use this built-in knowledge table:

| Runtime | Primary recommendation | Alternative |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Ruby/Rails | minitest + fixtures + capybara | rspec + factory_bot + shoulda-matchers |
| Node.js | vitest + @testing-library | jest + @testing-library |
| Next.js | vitest + @testing-library/react + playwright | jest + cypress |
| Python | pytest + pytest-cov | unittest |
| Go | stdlib testing + testify | stdlib only |
| Rust | cargo test (built-in) + mockall | — |
| PHP | phpunit + mockery | pest |
| Elixir | ExUnit (built-in) + ex_machina | — |

### B3. Framework selection

Use ask_user_question with the options below. If the ask tool is unavailable, ask the same question in plain text and wait for the answer.
"I detected this is a [Runtime/Framework] project with no test framework. I researched current best practices. Here are the options:
A) [Primary] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]. Supports: unit, integration, smoke, e2e
B) [Alternative] — [rationale]. Includes: [packages]
C) Skip — don't set up testing right now
RECOMMENDATION: Choose A because [reason based on project context]"

If user picks C → write `<harness-config-dir>/no-test-bootstrap`. Tell user: "If you change your mind later, delete `<harness-config-dir>/no-test-bootstrap` and re-run." Continue without tests.

If multiple runtimes detected (monorepo) → ask which runtime to set up first, with option to do both sequentially.

### B4. Install and configure

1. Install the chosen packages (npm/bun/gem/pip/etc.)
2. Create minimal config file
3. Create directory structure (test/, spec/, etc.)
4. Create one example test matching the project's code to verify setup works

If package installation fails → debug once. If still failing → revert with `git checkout -- package.json package-lock.json` (or equivalent for the runtime). Warn user and continue without tests.

### B4.5. First real tests

Generate 3-5 real tests for existing code:

1. **Find recently changed files:** `git log --since=30.days --name-only --format="" | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -10`
2. **Prioritize by risk:** Error handlers > business logic with conditionals > API endpoints > pure functions
3. **For each file:** Write one test that tests real behavior with meaningful assertions. Never `expect(x).toBeDefined()` — test what the code DOES.
4. Run each test. Passes → keep. Fails → fix once. Still fails → delete silently.
5. Generate at least 1 test, cap at 5.

Never import secrets, API keys, or credentials in test files. Use environment variables or test fixtures.

### B5. Verify

```bash
# Run the full test suite to confirm everything works
{detected test command}
```

If tests fail → debug once. If still failing → revert all bootstrap changes and warn user.

### B5.5. CI/CD pipeline

```bash
# Check CI provider
ls -d .github/ 2>/dev/null && echo "CI:github"
ls .gitlab-ci.yml .circleci/ bitrise.yml 2>/dev/null
```

If `.github/` exists (or no CI detected — default to GitHub Actions):
Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` with:
- `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`
- Appropriate setup action for the runtime (setup-node, setup-ruby, setup-python, etc.)
- The same test command verified in B5
- Trigger: push + pull_request

If non-GitHub CI detected → skip CI generation with note: "Detected {provider} — CI pipeline generation supports GitHub Actions only. Add test step to your existing pipeline manually."

### B6. Create TESTING.md

First check: If TESTING.md already exists → read it and update/append rather than overwriting. Never destroy existing content.

Write TESTING.md with:
- Philosophy: "100% test coverage is the key to great vibe coding. Tests let you move fast, trust your instincts, and ship with confidence — without them, vibe coding is just yolo coding. With tests, it's a superpower."
- Framework name and version
- How to run tests (the verified command from B5)
- Test layers: Unit tests (what, where, when), Integration tests, Smoke tests, E2E tests
- Conventions: file naming, assertion style, setup/teardown patterns

### B7. Update the project's memory file

First check: If the memory file already has a `## Testing` section → skip. Don't duplicate.

Append a `## Testing` section:
- Run command and test directory
- Reference to TESTING.md
- Test expectations:
  - 100% test coverage is the goal — tests make vibe coding safe
  - When writing new functions, write a corresponding test
  - When fixing a bug, write a regression test
  - When adding error handling, write a test that triggers the error
  - When adding a conditional (if/else, switch), write tests for BOTH paths
  - Never commit code that makes existing tests fail

### B8. Commit

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

Only commit if there are changes. Stage all bootstrap files (config, test directory, TESTING.md, the project's memory file, .github/workflows/test.yml if created):
`git commit -m "chore: bootstrap test framework ({framework name})"`

---

## Step 5: Run tests (on merged code)

**Do NOT run `RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:migrate`** — `bin/test-lane` already calls
`db:test:prepare` internally, which loads the schema into the correct lane database.
Running bare test migrations without INSTANCE hits an orphan DB and corrupts structure.sql.

Run both test suites in parallel:

```bash
bin/test-lane 2>&1 | tee "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/ship_tests.txt" &
npm run test 2>&1 | tee "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/ship_vitest.txt" &
wait
```

After both complete, read the output files and check pass/fail.

**If any test fails:** Do NOT immediately stop. Apply the Test Failure Ownership Triage:

## Test Failure Ownership Triage

When tests fail, do NOT immediately stop. First, determine ownership:

### Step T1: Classify each failure

For each failing test:

1. **Get the files changed on this branch:**
   ```bash
   git diff origin/<base>...HEAD --name-only
   ```

2. **Classify the failure:**
   - **In-branch** if: the failing test file itself was modified on this branch, OR the test output references code that was changed on this branch, OR you can trace the failure to a change in the branch diff.
   - **Likely pre-existing** if: neither the test file nor the code it tests was modified on this branch, AND the failure is unrelated to any branch change you can identify.
   - **When ambiguous, default to in-branch.** It is safer to stop the developer than to let a broken test ship. Only classify as pre-existing when you are confident.

   This classification is heuristic — use your judgment reading the diff and the test output. You do not have a programmatic dependency graph.

### Step T2: Handle in-branch failures

**STOP.** These are your failures. Show them and do not proceed. The developer must fix their own broken tests before shipping.

### Step T3: Handle pre-existing failures

Check `REPO_MODE` by reading the project's memory file (CLAUDE.md on claude-code, AGENTS.md elsewhere) for any `## Repository Mode` section, or default to `unknown`.

**If REPO_MODE is `solo`:**

Use ask_user_question with the options below. If the ask tool is unavailable, ask the same question in plain text and wait for the answer.

> These test failures appear pre-existing (not caused by your branch changes):
>
> [list each failure with file:line and brief error description]
>
> Since this is a solo repo, you're the only one who will fix these.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose A — fix now while the context is fresh. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Investigate and fix now (human: ~2-4h / CC: ~15min) — Completeness: 10/10
> B) Create a Questimus ticket — fix after this branch lands — Completeness: 7/10
> C) Skip — I know about this, ship anyway — Completeness: 3/10

**If REPO_MODE is `collaborative` or `unknown`:**

Use ask_user_question with the options below. If the ask tool is unavailable, ask the same question in plain text and wait for the answer.

> These test failures appear pre-existing (not caused by your branch changes):
>
> [list each failure with file:line and brief error description]
>
> This is a collaborative repo — these may be someone else's responsibility.
>
> RECOMMENDATION: Choose B — assign it to whoever broke it so the right person fixes it. Completeness: 9/10.
> A) Investigate and fix now anyway — Completeness: 10/10
> B) Create a Questimus ticket assigned to the author — Completeness: 9/10
> C) Create a Questimus ticket — Completeness: 7/10
> D) Skip — ship anyway — Completeness: 3/10

### Step T4: Execute the chosen action

**If "Investigate and fix now":**
- Switch to a root-cause-first mindset (review-fix-technical-code's Iron Law): root cause first, then minimal fix.
- Fix the pre-existing failure.
- Commit the fix separately from the branch's changes: `git commit -m "fix: pre-existing test failure in <test-file>"`
- Continue with the workflow.

**If "Create a Questimus ticket":**
- Create the ticket via the questimus skill: `node questimus.js create --name "Pre-existing test failure: <test-name>" --desc-file <file> --state Backlog --priority urgent` (type Ticket, no label, assigned to Karol). The description includes: the error output, which branch it was noticed on, and the priority.
- Continue with the workflow — treat the pre-existing failure as non-blocking.

**If "Create a Questimus ticket assigned to the author" (collaborative only):**
- Find who likely broke it. Check BOTH the test file AND the production code it tests:
  ```bash
  # Who last touched the failing test?
  git log --format="%an (%ae)" -1 -- <failing-test-file>
  # Who last touched the production code the test covers? (often the actual breaker)
  git log --format="%an (%ae)" -1 -- <source-file-under-test>
  ```
  If these are different people, prefer the production code author — they likely introduced the regression.
- Create the ticket via the questimus skill: `node questimus.js create --name "Pre-existing test failure: <test-name>" --desc-file <file> --state Backlog --priority urgent` (type Ticket, no label). The description includes the error output, the branch, and "**Last modified by:** <author> / **Noticed by:** /ship on <date>". Assign to the author if they are a Questimus user; otherwise assign to Karol and note who should look at it in the body.
- Continue with the workflow.

**If "Skip":**
- Continue with the workflow.
- Note in output: "Pre-existing test failure skipped: <test-name>"

**After triage:** If any in-branch failures remain unfixed, **STOP**. Do not proceed. If all failures were pre-existing and handled (fixed, ticketed, assigned, or skipped), continue to Step 6.

**If all pass:** Continue silently — just note the counts briefly.

## Step 6: Eval Suites (conditional)

**Skip-flag check (before anything else):** if `evals` is in Step 0.5's resolved skip set (quick mode, `--skip-evals`, or CLAUDE.md `Skip: evals`), skip this step unconditionally — print "Evals skipped (quick mode / --skip-evals / CLAUDE.md config)." and continue to Step 7. Don't even check for prompt-file changes first; the skip applies regardless of what's in the diff.

Otherwise: evals are mandatory when prompt-related files change. Skip this step entirely if no prompt files are in the diff.

**1. Check if the diff touches prompt-related files:**

```bash
git diff origin/<base> --name-only
```

Match against these patterns (from CLAUDE.md):
- `app/services/*_prompt_builder.rb`
- `app/services/*_generation_service.rb`, `*_writer_service.rb`, `*_designer_service.rb`
- `app/services/*_evaluator.rb`, `*_scorer.rb`, `*_classifier_service.rb`, `*_analyzer.rb`
- `app/services/concerns/*voice*.rb`, `*writing*.rb`, `*prompt*.rb`, `*token*.rb`
- `app/services/chat_tools/*.rb`, `app/services/x_thread_tools/*.rb`
- `config/system_prompts/*.txt`
- `test/evals/**/*` (eval infrastructure changes affect all suites)

**If no matches:** Print "No prompt-related files changed — skipping evals." and continue to Step 7. (Corrected from an earlier version of this file that said "Step 9" — evals precede the coverage audit (7) and plan-completion audit (8), not the pre-landing review.)

**2. Identify affected eval suites:**

Each eval runner (`test/evals/*_eval_runner.rb`) declares `PROMPT_SOURCE_FILES` listing which source files affect it. Grep these to find which suites match the changed files:

```bash
grep -l "changed_file_basename" test/evals/*_eval_runner.rb
```

Map runner → test file: `post_generation_eval_runner.rb` → `post_generation_eval_test.rb`.

**Special cases:**
- Changes to `test/evals/judges/*.rb`, `test/evals/support/*.rb`, or `test/evals/fixtures/` affect ALL suites that use those judges/support files. Check imports in the eval test files to determine which.
- Changes to `config/system_prompts/*.txt` — grep eval runners for the prompt filename to find affected suites.
- If unsure which suites are affected, run ALL suites that could plausibly be impacted. Over-testing is better than missing a regression.

**3. Run affected suites at `EVAL_JUDGE_TIER=full`:**

`/ship` is a pre-merge gate, so always use full tier (Sonnet structural + Opus persona judges).

```bash
EVAL_JUDGE_TIER=full EVAL_VERBOSE=1 bin/test-lane --eval test/evals/<suite>_eval_test.rb 2>&1 | tee "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/ship_evals.txt"
```

If multiple suites need to run, run them sequentially (each needs a test lane). If the first suite fails, stop immediately — don't burn API cost on remaining suites.

**Long eval suites (30+ min):** Run with an extended timeout. The eval command above blocks until complete; set the shell (bash) `timeout` parameter to `5400000` (90 minutes) for long suites. If the suite times out, treat as a failure — don't ship with unknown eval results.

**4. Check results:**

- **If any eval fails:** Show the failures, the cost dashboard, and **STOP**. Do not proceed.
- **If all pass:** Note pass counts and cost. Continue to Step 7.

**5. Save eval output** — include eval results and cost dashboard in the PR body (Step 19).

**Tier reference (for context — /ship always uses `full`):**
| Tier | When | Speed (cached) | Cost |
|------|------|----------------|------|
| `fast` (Haiku) | Dev iteration, smoke tests | ~5s (14x faster) | ~$0.07/run |
| `standard` (Sonnet) | Default dev, `bin/test-lane --eval` | ~17s (4x faster) | ~$0.37/run |
| `full` (Opus persona) | **`/ship` and pre-merge** | ~72s (baseline) | ~$1.27/run |
