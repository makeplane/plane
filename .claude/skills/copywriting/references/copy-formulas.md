# Copy Formulas

Proven frameworks for persuasive writing.

## AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action)

The classic framework. Works for landing pages, ads, sales emails.

```
ATTENTION: Bold claim or pattern interrupt
INTEREST: Explain why this matters to them
DESIRE: Paint the picture of transformation
ACTION: Clear CTA with urgency
```

**Example:**
```
[A] Stop losing 80% of your leads.
[I] Most businesses capture emails but never convert them.
    The problem isn't your product—it's your follow-up.
[D] Imagine waking up to sales notifications while you sleep.
    Our automation sends the right message at the right time.
[A] Start your free trial → No credit card required.
```

## PAS (Problem → Agitate → Solution)

Dan Kennedy's "most reliable formula." Works for email, sales pages.

```
PROBLEM: Name the specific pain
AGITATE: Twist the knife (consequences, frustration)
SOLUTION: Present your offer as the answer
```

**Example:**
```
[P] You're posting on LinkedIn daily but getting zero leads.
[A] Hours of content creation. Crickets in your DMs.
    Meanwhile, competitors with worse products are
    booking calls. What do they know that you don't?
[S] Our LinkedIn system generates 15+ qualified leads/week
    using posts that take 10 minutes to write.
```

## BAB (Before → After → Bridge)

Best for testimonials, case studies, transformation stories.

```
BEFORE: Describe the painful current state
AFTER: Paint the desired future state
BRIDGE: Your product/service is the bridge
```

**Example:**
```
[B] Sarah spent 4 hours/day on customer support emails.
    Burnout was inevitable. Her team was drowning.
[A] Now she handles 3x the volume in 1 hour.
    Her team focuses on growth, not firefighting.
[BR] The bridge? Our AI support assistant that learns
     your voice and handles 80% of tickets automatically.
```

## 4Ps (Promise → Picture → Proof → Push)

Long-form sales pages, webinar pitches.

```
PROMISE: Bold outcome claim
PICTURE: Help them visualize having it
PROOF: Evidence it works (testimonials, data)
PUSH: Create urgency, clear CTA
```

## 4Us (Urgent + Unique + Useful + Ultra-specific)

Headlines, subject lines, hooks.

| U | Meaning | Example |
|---|---------|---------|
| Urgent | Time-sensitive | "24 hours left" |
| Unique | Different from competition | "The only..." |
| Useful | Clear benefit | "Save 10 hours/week" |
| Ultra-specific | Precise details | "47% increase in 30 days" |

**Example headline:**
"[24 hours] The only cold email template that books [23 calls/month]"

## FAB (Feature → Advantage → Benefit)

Product descriptions, feature announcements.

```
FEATURE: What it is
ADVANTAGE: What it does better
BENEFIT: Why they care
```

**Example:**
```
[F] One-click export to PDF
[A] No more screenshots or manual formatting
[B] Share professional reports in seconds, not hours
```

## ACCA (Awareness → Comprehension → Conviction → Action)

Educational content, complex products.

```
AWARENESS: Make them aware of the problem/opportunity
COMPREHENSION: Help them understand the solution
CONVICTION: Build belief with proof
ACTION: Direct next step
```

## The 1-2-3-4 Formula

Quick, punchy copy. Social posts, short emails.

```
1. What I've got for you
2. What it will do for you
3. Who am I? (credibility)
4. What you need to do next
```

## Star-Chain-Hook

Storytelling format for longer content.

```
STAR: Introduce the hero (reader or case study)
CHAIN: Series of facts, benefits, reasons
HOOK: Compelling CTA
```
