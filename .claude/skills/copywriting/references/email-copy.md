# Email Copy

Subject lines, body copy, and CTAs that convert.

## Subject Line Formulas

### Curiosity Gap
```
The [thing] nobody talks about
I was wrong about [topic]
This changes everything
Quick question about [topic]
[Name], noticed something...
```

### Benefit-Driven
```
[Achieve X] in [timeframe]
How to [benefit] without [pain]
Get [result] starting today
Your [thing] is ready
```

### Question Format
```
Are you [doing thing]?
Can I ask you something?
Is [common belief] true?
What if [benefit]?
Quick question?
```

### Urgency
```
[X hours] left
Last chance: [benefit]
Closing tonight
Don't miss this
Final reminder
```

### Personal/Conversational
```
Just between us
I owe you an apology
Can we talk?
I noticed you [action]
Weird request
```

### Number-Based
```
[X] ways to [benefit]
[X]% off ends tonight
[X] people already joined
In [X] minutes, you could...
```

## Subject Line Power Tips

- **47%** of opens based on subject line alone
- Personalized = **26%** higher open rate
- Urgency = **22%** higher open rate
- Keep under **50 characters** for mobile
- Emojis: test, don't assume they work

## Preview Text

The text after subject line. Use it to:
- Extend the curiosity
- Add context
- Create contrast

**Example:**
```
Subject: Quick question?
Preview: (no, I'm not selling anything)
```

### Short Email (50-100 words)
```
[Hook: 1 sentence that grabs attention]

```

### Standard Email (100-200 words)
```
[Opening hook]

[Problem acknowledgment]

[Solution/Value introduction]

[Key benefit 1]
[Key benefit 2]

[Social proof if relevant]

[CTA]

[P.S. - reinforce CTA or add urgency]
```

### Story Email
```
[Start in the middle of action]

[Quick backstory]

[The turning point]

[CTA]
```

## Opening Lines (Never "Hi [Name]")

**Start with value or story:**
