# Advanced Sequential Thinking Techniques

Complex problem-solving patterns.

## Spiral Refinement

Return to concepts with progressively deeper understanding.

```
Thought 1/7: Initial design (surface)
Thought 2/7: Discover constraint A
Thought 3/7: Refine for A
Thought 4/7: Discover constraint B
Thought 5/7: Refine for both A and B
Thought 6/7: Integration reveals edge case
Thought 7/7: Final design addressing all constraints
```

**Use for**: Complex systems where constraints emerge iteratively.
**Key**: Each return is refinement, not restart.

## Hypothesis-Driven Investigation

Systematic hypothesis generation and testing.

```
Thought 1/6: Observe symptoms
Thought 2/6 [HYPOTHESIS]: Explanation X
Thought 3/6 [VERIFICATION]: Test X—partial match
Thought 4/6 [REFINED HYPOTHESIS]: Adjusted Y
Thought 5/6 [VERIFICATION]: Test Y—confirmed
Thought 6/6 [FINAL]: Solution based on verified Y
```

**Use for**: Debugging, root cause analysis, diagnostics.
**Pattern**: Generate → Test → Refine → Re-test loop.

## Multi-Branch Convergence

Explore alternatives, then synthesize best approach.

```
Thought 2/8: Multiple viable approaches
Thought 3/8 [BRANCH A]: Approach A benefits
Thought 4/8 [BRANCH A]: Approach A drawbacks
Thought 5/8 [BRANCH B]: Approach B benefits
Thought 6/8 [BRANCH B]: Approach B drawbacks
Thought 7/8 [CONVERGENCE]: Hybrid combining A's X with B's Y
Thought 8/8 [FINAL]: Hybrid superior to either alone
```

**Use for**: Complex decisions where neither option clearly best.
**Key**: Convergence often yields better solution than either branch.

## Progressive Context Deepening

Build understanding in layers from abstract to concrete.

```
Thought 1/9: High-level problem
Thought 2/9: Identify major components
Thought 3/9: Zoom into component A (detailed)
Thought 4/9: Zoom into component B (detailed)
Thought 5/9: Identify A-B interactions
Thought 6/9: Discover emergent constraint
Thought 7/9 [REVISION of 3-4]: Adjust for interaction
Thought 8/9: Verify complete system
Thought 9/9 [FINAL]: Integrated solution
```

**Use for**: System design, architecture, integration problems.
**Pattern**: Abstract → Components → Details → Interactions → Integration.
