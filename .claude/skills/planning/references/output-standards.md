# Output Standards & Quality

## Plan File Format

**Important:**
- DO NOT create plans or reports in USER directory.
- ALWAYS create plans or reports in CURRENT WORKING PROJECT DIRECTORY.

### YAML Frontmatter (Required for plan.md)

All `plan.md` files MUST include YAML frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: "{Brief plan title}"
description: "{One-sentence summary for card preview}"
status: pending  # pending | in-progress | completed | cancelled
priority: P2     # P1 (High) | P2 (Medium) | P3 (Low)
effort: 4h       # Estimated total effort
issue: 74        # GitHub issue number (if applicable)
branch: kai/feat/feature-name
tags: [frontend, api]  # Category tags
created: 2025-12-16
---
```

### Auto-Population Rules

When creating plans, auto-populate these fields:
- **title**: Extract from task description
- **description**: First sentence of Overview section
- **status**: Always `pending` for new plans
- **priority**: From user request or default `P2`
- **effort**: Sum of phase estimates
- **issue**: Parse from branch name or context
- **branch**: Current git branch (`git branch --show-current`)
- **tags**: Infer from task keywords (e.g., frontend, backend, api, auth)
- **created**: Today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format

### Tag Vocabulary (Recommended)

Use these predefined tags for consistency:
- **Type**: `feature`, `bugfix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `infra`
- **Domain**: `frontend`, `backend`, `database`, `api`, `auth`
- **Scope**: `critical`, `tech-debt`, `experimental`

## Task Breakdown

- Transform complex requirements into manageable, actionable tasks
- Each task independently executable with clear dependencies
- Prioritize by dependencies, risk, business value
- Eliminate ambiguity in instructions
- Include specific file paths for all modifications
- Provide clear acceptance criteria per task

### File Management

**Important:**
- DO NOT create plans or reports in USER directory.
- ALWAYS create plans or reports in CURRENT WORKING PROJECT DIRECTORY.

List affected files with:
- Full paths (not relative)
- Action type (modify/create/delete)
- Brief change description
- Dependencies on other changes
- Fully respect the `./docs/development-rules.md` file.

## Workflow Process

1. **Initial Analysis** → Read docs, understand context
2. **Research Phase** → Spawn researchers in parallel, investigate approaches
3. **Synthesis** → Analyze reports, identify optimal solution
4. **Design Phase** → Create architecture, implementation design
5. **Plan Documentation** → Write comprehensive plan in Markdown
6. **Review & Refine** → Ensure completeness, clarity, actionability

## Output Requirements

**Important:**
- DO NOT create plans or reports in USER directory.
- ALWAYS create plans or reports in CURRENT WORKING PROJECT DIRECTORY.

### What Planners Do
- Create plans ONLY (no implementation)
- Provide plan file path and summary
- Self-contained plans with necessary context
- Code snippets/pseudocode when clarifying
- Multiple options with trade-offs when appropriate
- Fully respect the `./docs/development-rules.md` file.

### Writing Style
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for concision
- Focus clarity over eloquence
- Use bullets and lists
- Short sentences
- Remove unnecessary words
- Prioritize actionable info

### Unresolved Questions
**IMPORTANT:** Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask users for unresolved questions at the end
- Questions needing clarification
- Technical decisions requiring input
- Unknowns impacting implementation
- Trade-offs requiring business decisions
Revise the plan and phases based on the answers.

## Quality Standards

### Thoroughness
- Thorough and specific in research/planning
- Consider edge cases, failure modes
- Think through entire user journey
- Document all assumptions

### Maintainability
- Consider long-term maintainability
- Design for future modifications
- Document decision rationale
- Avoid over-engineering
- Fully respect the `./docs/development-rules.md` file.

### Research Depth
- When uncertain, research more
- Multiple options with clear trade-offs
- Validate against best practices
- Consider industry standards

### Security & Performance
- Address all security concerns
- Identify performance implications
- Plan for scalability
- Consider resource constraints

### Implementability
- Detailed enough for junior developers
- Validate against existing patterns
- Ensure codebase standards consistency
- Provide clear examples

**Remember:** Plan quality determines implementation success. Be comprehensive, consider all solution aspects.
