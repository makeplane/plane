# Plan Creation & Organization

## Directory Structure

### Plan Location

**Important:**
- DO NOT create plans or reports in USER directory.
- ALWAYS create plans or reports in CURRENT WORKING PROJECT DIRECTORY.

Use `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section injected by hooks. This is the full computed path.

**Example:** `plans/251101-1505-authentication/` or `ai_docs/feature/MRR-1453/`

### File Organization

IN CURRENT WORKING PROJECT DIRECTORY:
```
{plan-dir}/                                    # From `Plan dir:` in ## Naming
├── research/
│   ├── researcher-XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── reports/
│   ├── scout-report.md
│   ├── researcher-report.md
│   └── ...
├── plan.md                                    # Overview access point
├── phase-01-setup-environment.md              # Setup environment
├── phase-02-implement-database.md             # Database models
├── phase-03-implement-api-endpoints.md        # API endpoints
├── phase-04-implement-ui-components.md        # UI components
├── phase-05-implement-authentication.md       # Auth & authorization
├── phase-06-implement-profile.md              # Profile page
└── phase-07-write-tests.md                    # Tests
```

### Active Plan State Tracking

Check the `## Plan Context` section injected by hooks:
- **"Plan: {path}"** = Active plan - use for reports
- **"Suggested: {path}"** = Branch-matched, hint only - do NOT auto-use
- **"Plan: none"** = No active plan

**Pre-Creation Check:**
1. If "Plan:" shows a path → ask "Continue with existing plan? [Y/n]"
2. If "Suggested:" shows a path → inform user (hint only, do NOT auto-use)
3. If "Plan: none" → create new plan using naming from `## Naming` section

**After Creating Plan:**
```bash
# Update session state so subagents get the new plan context:
node .claude/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs {plan-dir}
```

**Report Output Rules:**
1. Use `Report:` and `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section
2. Active plans use plan-specific reports path
3. Suggested plans use default reports path to prevent old plan pollution

## File Structure

**Important:**
- DO NOT create plans or reports in USER directory.
- ALWAYS create plans or reports in CURRENT WORKING PROJECT DIRECTORY.

### Overview Plan (plan.md)

**IMPORTANT:** All plan.md files MUST include YAML frontmatter. See `output-standards.md` for schema.

**Example plan.md structure:**

# Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview

Brief description of what this plan accomplishes.

## Phases

| # | Phase | Status | Effort | Link |
|---|-------|--------|--------|------|
| 1 | Setup | Pending | 2h | [phase-01](./phase-01-setup.md) |
| 2 | Implementation | Pending | 4h | [phase-02](./phase-02-impl.md) |
| 3 | Testing | Pending | 2h | [phase-03](./phase-03-test.md) |
