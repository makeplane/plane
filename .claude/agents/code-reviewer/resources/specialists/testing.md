# Testing Specialist Review Checklist

Scope: Always-on (every review)
Output: JSON objects, one finding per line. Schema:
{"severity":"CRITICAL|INFORMATIONAL","confidence":N,"path":"file","line":N,"category":"testing","summary":"...","fix":"...","fingerprint":"path:line:testing","specialist":"testing"}
Optional: line, fix, fingerprint, evidence, test_stub.
If no findings: output `NO FINDINGS` and nothing else.

## Categories

### Missing Negative-Path Tests
- New code paths that handle errors, rejections, or invalid input with NO corresponding test
- Guard clauses and early returns that are untested
- Error branches in try/catch, rescue, or error boundaries with no failure-path test
- Permission/auth checks that are asserted in code but never tested for the "denied" case

### Missing Edge-Case Coverage
- Boundary values: zero, negative, max-int, empty string, empty array, nil/null/undefined
- Single-element collections (off-by-one on loops)
- Unicode and special characters in user-facing inputs
- Concurrent access patterns with no race-condition test

### Test Isolation Violations
- Tests sharing mutable state (class variables, global singletons, DB records not cleaned up)
- Order-dependent tests (pass in sequence, fail when randomized)
- Tests that depend on system clock, timezone, or locale
- Tests that make real network calls instead of using stubs/mocks

### Flaky Test Patterns
- Timing-dependent assertions (sleep, setTimeout, waitFor with tight timeouts)
- Assertions on ordering of unordered results (hash keys, Set iteration, async resolution order)
- Tests that depend on external services (APIs, databases) without fallback
- Randomized test data without seed control

### Security Enforcement Tests Missing
- Auth/authz checks in controllers with no test for the "unauthorized" case
- Rate limiting logic with no test proving it actually blocks
- Input sanitization with no test for malicious input
- CSRF/CORS configuration with no integration test

### Coverage Gaps
- New public methods/functions with zero test coverage
- Changed methods where existing tests only cover the old behavior, not the new branch
- Utility functions called from multiple places but tested only indirectly
