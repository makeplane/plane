# Using Three.js and React Three Fiber in Remotion

Follow React Three Fiber and Three.js best practices.  
Only the following Remotion-specific rules need to be followed:

## Prerequisites

First, the `@remotion/three` package needs to be installed.  
If it is not, use the following command:

```bash
npx remotion add @remotion/three # If project uses npm
bunx remotion add @remotion/three # If project uses bun
yarn remotion add @remotion/three # If project uses yarn
pnpm exec remotion add @remotion/three # If project uses pnpm
```

## Using ThreeCanvas

You MUST wrap 3D content in `<ThreeCanvas>` and include proper lighting.  
`<ThreeCanvas>` MUST have a `width` and `height` prop.

```tsx
import { ThreeCanvas } from "@remotion/three";
import { useVideoConfig } from "remotion";

const { width, height } = useVideoConfig();

<ThreeCanvas width={width} height={height}>
  <ambientLight intensity={0.4} />
  <directionalLight position={[5, 5, 5]} intensity={0.8} />
  <mesh>
    <sphereGeometry args={[1, 32, 32]} />
    <meshStandardMaterial color="red" />
  </mesh>
</ThreeCanvas>;
```

## No animations not driven by `useCurrentFrame()`

Shaders, models etc MUST NOT animate by themselves.  
No animations are allowed unless they are driven by `useCurrentFrame()`.  
Otherwise, it will cause flickering during rendering.

Using `useFrame()` from `@react-three/fiber` is forbidden.

## Animate using `useCurrentFrame()`

Use `useCurrentFrame()` to perform animations.

```tsx
const frame = useCurrentFrame();
const rotationY = frame * 0.02;

<mesh rotation={[0, rotationY, 0]}>
  <boxGeometry args={[2, 2, 2]} />
  <meshStandardMaterial color="#4a9eff" />
</mesh>;
```

## Using `<Sequence>` inside `<ThreeCanvas>`

The `layout` prop of any `<Sequence>` inside a `<ThreeCanvas>` must be set to `none`.

```tsx
import { Sequence } from "remotion";
import { ThreeCanvas } from "@remotion/three";

const { width, height } = useVideoConfig();

<ThreeCanvas width={width} height={height}>
  <Sequence layout="none">
    <mesh>
      <boxGeometry args={[2, 2, 2]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="#4a9eff" />
    </mesh>
  </Sequence>
</ThreeCanvas>;
```
