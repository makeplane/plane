# Feature Specification: Global Keyboard Shortcut for New Issue

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-a-global`  
**Created**: 2024-12-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a global keyboard shortcut to open the \"New Issue\" modal from anywhere in the app.
- macOS: ⌘ + N
- Windows/Linux: Ctrl + N

This should work globally across all pages and components, with proper focus management to avoid conflicts with text editing."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories MUST follow Constitution Principle I (User-First Design).
  Stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by business value.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers standalone value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently  
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Quick Issue Creation (Priority: P1)

A user wants to quickly create a new issue without navigating to a specific page or clicking through multiple UI elements. They should be able to press the keyboard shortcut from anywhere in the application to instantly open the new issue modal.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - providing immediate access to issue creation from any context, significantly improving workflow efficiency for power users.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by pressing the keyboard shortcut from any page and verifying the new issue modal opens correctly, delivering immediate productivity value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on any page in the application, **When** they press ⌘+N (macOS) or Ctrl+N (Windows/Linux), **Then** the new issue modal opens immediately
2. **Given** a user has the new issue modal open, **When** they press the keyboard shortcut again, **Then** the modal remains open (no duplicate modals)
3. **Given** a user is focused on a text input field, **When** they press the keyboard shortcut, **Then** the new issue modal opens and the text input retains focus for continued editing

---

### User Story 2 - Focus Management (Priority: P2)

A user should be able to use the keyboard shortcut without interfering with their current text editing activities. The system should intelligently handle focus states to prevent conflicts.

**Why this priority**: Essential for preventing user frustration when the shortcut accidentally triggers during text editing, maintaining productivity without disruption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by typing in various text fields and verifying the shortcut behavior doesn't interfere with normal text editing workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is typing in a text area or input field, **When** they press the keyboard shortcut, **Then** the modal opens without disrupting their text input
2. **Given** a user is editing content in a rich text editor, **When** they press the keyboard shortcut, **Then** the modal opens and preserves their editing context
3. **Given** a user is in a code editor or terminal-like interface, **When** they press the keyboard shortcut, **Then** the modal opens without affecting the code editing session

---

### User Story 3 - Visual Feedback and Discovery (Priority: P3)

A user should be able to discover the keyboard shortcut through visual cues and understand its availability across the application.

**Why this priority**: Improves feature discoverability and user onboarding, helping users understand the power-user capabilities available to them.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by checking that tooltips and UI hints are present and accurate, delivering improved user guidance.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sees the "New Issue" button, **When** they hover over it, **Then** they see a tooltip indicating the keyboard shortcut
2. **Given** a user is looking for keyboard shortcuts, **When** they access the help or shortcuts documentation, **Then** they find information about the new issue shortcut
3. **Given** a user presses an incorrect key combination, **When** no action occurs, **Then** they understand the specific key combination required

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user presses the shortcut while a modal is already open?
- How does the system handle the shortcut when the user is in fullscreen mode?
- What occurs if the user presses the shortcut while a confirmation dialog is active?
- How does the system behave when the user is in a restricted area where issue creation is not permitted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST respond to ⌘+N keyboard combination on macOS to open the new issue modal
- **FR-002**: System MUST respond to Ctrl+N keyboard combination on Windows/Linux to open the new issue modal  
- **FR-003**: System MUST open the new issue modal from any page or component in the application
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve text input focus when the shortcut is pressed during text editing
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent opening duplicate modals when the shortcut is pressed while a modal is already open
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the keyboard shortcut in tooltips on the New Issue button
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle the shortcut gracefully when issue creation is not permitted in the current context
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain consistent behavior across all supported browsers and operating systems

### Key Entities

- **Keyboard Shortcut**: A global key combination that triggers the new issue modal
- **New Issue Modal**: The existing modal component for creating new issues
- **Focus Context**: The current state of user input focus (text fields, editors, etc.)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can open the new issue modal in under 100ms from pressing the keyboard shortcut
- **SC-002**: 95% of users successfully open the new issue modal using the keyboard shortcut on first attempt
- **SC-003**: Zero instances of text input disruption when the shortcut is pressed during editing
- **SC-004**: Keyboard shortcut works consistently across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **SC-005**: Users can discover the keyboard shortcut through tooltips and documentation within 30 seconds
