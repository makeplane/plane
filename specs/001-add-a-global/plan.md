# Implementation Plan: Global Keyboard Shortcut for New Issue

**Branch**: `001-add-a-global` | **Date**: 2024-12-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-add-a-global/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a global keyboard shortcut (⌘+N / Ctrl+N) that opens the New Issue modal from anywhere in the Plane application. The solution uses a React hook for global event handling with intelligent focus management to prevent conflicts with text editing workflows.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, React 18.x, Next.js 14.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: React hooks, DOM event handling, existing modal system  
**Storage**: N/A (stateless keyboard event handling)  
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, user interaction tests  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend enhancement)  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms response time for modal opening  
**Constraints**: Must not interfere with text editing, must work across all pages  
**Scale/Scope**: Global application feature, affects all user workflows  

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**User-First Design**: Feature prioritizes user experience and accessibility ✅
**Open Source Commitment**: Maintains AGPL-3.0 compatibility ✅  
**Test-Driven Development**: TDD workflow planned with test-first approach ✅
**Monorepo Architecture**: Respects app boundaries and shared package structure ✅
**Performance & Scalability**: Meets <200ms p95 response time requirements ✅
**Security & Privacy**: Implements proper input validation and data protection ✅
