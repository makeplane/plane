# Transcribing audio

Remotion provides several built-in options for transcribing audio to generate captions:

- `@remotion/install-whisper-cpp` - Transcribe locally on a server using Whisper.cpp. Fast and free, but requires server infrastructure.

- `@remotion/whisper-web` - Transcribe in the browser using WebAssembly. No server needed and free, but slower due to WASM overhead.

- `@remotion/openai-whisper` - Use OpenAI Whisper API for cloud-based transcription. Fast and no server needed, but requires payment.
