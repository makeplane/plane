# Copy Enhancement Workflow

Analyze existing copy issues and enhance for better performance.

## When to Use

- User reports copy problems (unclear messaging, low engagement, weak CTAs)
- Content needs polish without complete rewrite
- Quick improvements to existing marketing materials

## Workflow Steps

1. **Screenshots provided** → Use `ai-multimodal` skill to analyze and describe issues in detail
2. **Videos provided** → Use `ai-multimodal` video-analysis to extract relevant copy issues
3. **Scout codebase** → `/scout:ext` (preferred) or `/scout` to find files needing enhancement
4. **Implement** → Use `fullstack-developer` agent to write enhanced copy into code files
