## Power Word Placement

| Location | Best Word Types |
|----------|----------------|
| Headlines | Curiosity, urgency, numbers |
| Subheadlines | Benefits, simplicity |
| CTAs | Action, value, urgency |
| Email subjects | Curiosity, urgency, personal |
| Body copy | Trust, results, emotion |

## Usage Tips

1. **Don't overuse** — 1-2 power words per headline
2. **Match context** — urgency for sales, curiosity for content
3. **A/B test** — what works for one audience may not for another
4. **Be authentic** — false urgency/exclusivity backfires
5. **Combine strategically** — pair urgency with value
