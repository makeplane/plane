# Getting started with local setup (2025-10-09 01:56Z)

_**User (2025-10-09 01:56Z)**_

Look at this file @CONTRIBUTING.md and walk me through how to get things up and running on my local machine

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

Looking at the CONTRIBUTING.md file, here's how to get Plane up and running on your local machine:

## Plan
- Review system requirements and dependencies
- Follow the step-by-step setup process
- Understand the project structure
- Access the applications after setup

## Setup Process

### 1. System Requirements
- **Docker Engine** (installed and running)
- **Node.js** version 20+ (LTS version)
- **Python** version 3.8+
- **Postgres** version v14
- **Redis** version v6.2.7
- **Memory**: Minimum **12 GB RAM** (‚ö†Ô∏è 8 GB may cause failures)

### 2. Clone and Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/makeplane/plane.git [folder-name]
cd [folder-name]
chmod +x setup.sh
```

### 3. Run Setup Script
```bash
./setup.sh
```

### 4. Start Docker Containers
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
```

### 5. Start Web Applications
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 6. Access the Applications
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3001/god-mode/ (register as instance admin)
- **Main App**: http://localhost:3000 (login with same credentials)

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: Django project in `apps/api/`
- **Frontend**: Multiple Next.js apps (admin, web, space)
- **Monorepo**: All components in single repository

## Steps Summary
1. Install required dependencies (Docker, Node.js 20+, Python 3.8+, Postgres v14, Redis v6.2.7)
2. Clone repository and run setup script
3. Start Docker containers for backend services
4. Start frontend development servers
5. Access admin panel to register, then main app to login

## Notes
- Refresh browser if changes don't auto-reload
- Minimum 12 GB RAM strongly recommended
- Backend runs in Docker, frontend runs via pnpm dev
- Admin registration required before accessing main app

_**User (2025-10-09 01:56Z)**_

How can I check if I have all the required dependencies?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

Here are the commands to check if you have all the required dependencies:

## Check Required Dependencies

### 1. Docker Engine
```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```
Should show Docker version info. If not installed, download from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### 2. Node.js (version 20+)
```bash
node --version
```
Should show v20.x.x or higher. If not, download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases)

### 3. Python (version 3.8+)
```bash
python3 --version
# or
python --version
```
Should show 3.8.x or higher. If not, download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 4. PostgreSQL (version v14)
```bash
psql --version
```
Should show PostgreSQL 14.x. If not, download from [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### 5. Redis (version v6.2.7)
```bash
redis-server --version
```
Should show Redis 6.2.7 or compatible version. If not, download from [redis.io](https://redis.io/download)

### 6. System Memory
```bash
# macOS
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Memory:"

# Linux
free -h

# Windows (in PowerShell)
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PhysicalMemory | Measure-Object -Property Capacity -Sum
```
Should show at least 12 GB RAM (8 GB minimum, but may cause issues)

### 7. pnpm (for package management)
```bash
pnpm --version
```
If not installed:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Quick Check Script
You can run all checks at once:
```bash
echo "Docker: $(docker --version)"
echo "Node.js: $(node --version)"
echo "Python: $(python3 --version)"
echo "PostgreSQL: $(psql --version)"
echo "Redis: $(redis-server --version)"
echo "pnpm: $(pnpm --version)"
```

## Notes
- If any dependency is missing, install it before running `./setup.sh`
- Docker must be running (not just installed)
- Memory check is critical - less than 12 GB may cause setup failures

This is what I got:
(base) abdulmujeebahmed@AbdulMujeebs-MacBook-Pro plane % echo "Docker: $(docker --version)"
echo "Node.js: $(node --version)"
echo "Python: $(python3 --version)"
echo "PostgreSQL: $(psql --version)"
echo "Redis: $(redis-server --version)"
echo "pnpm: $(pnpm --version)"
Docker: Docker version 28.4.0, build d8eb465
Node.js: v24.8.0
Python: Python 3.13.7
PostgreSQL: psql (PostgreSQL) 14.19 (Homebrew)
zsh: command not found: redis-server
Redis: 
pnpm: 10.12.1

## Dependency Status

‚úÖ **Docker**: v28.4.0 (Good - newer than required)  
‚úÖ **Node.js**: v24.8.0 (Good - meets v20+ requirement)  
‚úÖ **Python**: v3.13.7 (Good - exceeds v3.8+ requirement)  
‚úÖ **PostgreSQL**: v14.19 (Perfect - exactly v14)  
‚ùå **Redis**: Not found  
‚úÖ **pnpm**: v10.12.1 (Good)  

## Missing Dependency: Redis

You need to install Redis. Since you're on macOS with Homebrew (I can see PostgreSQL was installed via Homebrew), install Redis:

```bash
brew install redis
```

After installation, start Redis service:
```bash
brew services start redis
```

## Verify Redis Installation
```bash
redis-server --version
```

## Alternative Redis Installation
If you prefer not to use Homebrew:
```bash
# Download and install Redis manually
curl -O http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
tar xzf redis-stable.tar.gz
cd redis-stable
make
```

## Next Steps
Once Redis is installed and running:
1. Run the dependency check again to confirm all requirements
2. Proceed with the Plane setup:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Notes
- Your system meets all other requirements
- Redis will run as a service in the background
- The Docker containers will likely include Redis, but local Redis may be needed for development

_**User (2025-10-09 01:56Z)**_

Did i do it right?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

Perfect! ‚úÖ You did everything correctly.

## What You Accomplished
- **Installed Redis**: v8.2.2 (exceeds the required v6.2.7)
- **Started Redis service**: Running as a background service
- **Verified installation**: `redis-server --version` confirms it's working

## Updated Dependency Status
‚úÖ **Docker**: v28.4.0  
‚úÖ **Node.js**: v24.8.0  
‚úÖ **Python**: v3.13.7  
‚úÖ **PostgreSQL**: v14.19  
‚úÖ **Redis**: v8.2.2  
‚úÖ **pnpm**: v10.12.1  

## You're Ready to Proceed
All dependencies are now installed and working. You can continue with the Plane setup:

```bash
./setup.sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up
pnpm dev
```

## Notes
- Redis is running as a background service and will start automatically at login
- Your Redis version (8.2.2) is newer than required, which is fine
- All other dependencies already met or exceeded requirements

You're all set to get Plane running locally!

_**User (2025-10-09 01:56Z)**_

Do I need to do anything?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

No, you don't need to do anything right now! 

## What's Happening
The setup is working perfectly and running as expected:

‚úÖ **Setup script completed successfully** - Environment files created, dependencies installed  
üîÑ **Docker containers are building** - Currently building Python dependencies (this takes time)

## Current Status
- Docker is pulling and building all required services (database, Redis, message queue, etc.)
- The build process is at step 11/16 and installing Python packages
- This is normal and can take several minutes (especially the first time)

## Just Wait
Let the Docker build process complete. You'll see:
- More build progress messages
- Eventually "Services started" or similar success messages
- Then you can run `pnpm dev` to start the frontend

## Expected Timeline
- First-time build: 5-15 minutes depending on your internet/CPU
- Subsequent builds: Much faster due to Docker caching

The process is working correctly - just be patient while it finishes building all the containers!

_**User (2025-10-09 01:56Z)**_

Am i good to run pnpm dev?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

Yes! ‚úÖ You're good to run `pnpm dev`.

## What's Working
- **Database migrations**: All completed successfully
- **API server**: Running at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
- **Background workers**: Celery workers and beat scheduler running
- **Message queue**: RabbitMQ connected and processing tasks
- **All services**: Up and running properly

## Next Step
Open a new terminal window and run:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

## What You'll See
- Frontend development servers starting up
- Multiple Next.js apps (web, admin, space) will start
- You'll get URLs for each application

## Access Points
After `pnpm dev` starts:
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:3001/god-mode/ (register as instance admin)
- **Main App**: http://localhost:3000 (login with same credentials)

## Notes
- Keep the Docker containers running in the first terminal
- The new terminal with `pnpm dev` will handle the frontend
- All backend services are ready and waiting for the frontend to connect

You're all set to start the frontend development servers!
