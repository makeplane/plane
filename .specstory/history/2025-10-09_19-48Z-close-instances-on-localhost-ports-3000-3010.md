I'll help you close all instances running on localhost ports 3000-3010. Let me create a plan and execute it.

## Todo List

- [-] Find all processes running on ports 3000-3010
- [ ] Kill the identified processes

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
lsof -ti:3000-3010
```

```
49557
49558

```

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
ps -p 49557,49558 -o pid,ppid,command
```

```
  PID  PPID COMMAND
49557 49487 next-server (v14.2.32) 
49558 49527 next-server (v14.2.32) 

```

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
kill -9 49557 49558
```

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [x] Find all processes running on ports 3000-3010
- [x] Kill the identified processes

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
lsof -ti:3000-3010
```

## Plan
- Find processes running on ports 3000-3010
- Kill the identified processes
- Verify ports are free

## Steps Taken
1. **Identified processes**: Found 2 Next.js servers (PIDs 49557, 49558) running on ports in range 3000-3010
2. **Killed processes**: Used `kill -9` to forcefully terminate both processes
3. **Verified cleanup**: Confirmed no processes are still running on those ports

## Notes
- Found 2 Next.js development servers that were terminated
- Exit code 1 from final verification confirms no processes remain on ports 3000-3010
- All localhost ports 3000-3010 are now free
